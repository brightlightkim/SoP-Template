%% Why do you wish to attend graduate school? What would you like to study? Keep it broad, details come-in later
A few years ago, I found myself in a challenging relationship with someone who struggled deeply with emotional turmoil. Despite her frequent bouts of distress, I approached each situation with patience, kindness, and a genuine desire to understand her pain. Over time, she confided in me about her past experiences with emotional manipulation and abuse, which had severely impacted her self-worth. This revelation was a pivotal moment for me. I became acutely aware of the profound impact that words and communication can have on an individual's psyche. This realization ignited my interest in \textbf{Natural Language Processing (NLP)} as a means to harness technology for emotional healing and support.
\\
% My decision to pursue graduate studies is a natural outcome of my experiences gained as a master's student at the \textbf{Indian Institute of Science (IISc)} and more recently as a research staff in the \textbf{Systems Group} at \textbf{Microsoft Research India}. I am interested in \textbf{distributed systems} and \textbf{data-intensive cloud computing} — in particular, the system-side problems associated with \textbf{learning and deploying machine learning models at scale}. My research endeavors have resulted in publications at well-known conferences such as \textbf{OSDI [1]} and \textbf{ICDE [3]}. Through graduate studies at \school, I wish to take the first step towards my long term goal of a career in research.

%% Describe 2-3 past projects that might be relevant to your research interests. (10-12 lines per project)

\textbf{Research Experiences}\\
% PROJECT 1: P3 - Distributed Graph Neural Network Training at Scale
Determined to make a difference, I reached out to \textbf{Professor Nancy Fulda} at BYU's \textbf{Deep Representations and Architectures for Generative systems and Natural language understanding (DRAGN) Lab}. Under her guidance, I embarked on a project to develop a software application utilizing BYU's large language model, EVE. We focused on pretraining the model with curated content emphasizing self-worth, prevention strategies against physical and verbal abuse, and therapeutic counseling information. The goal was to create a tool that could provide users with resources for healing and empowerment. Our project's impact was recognized when we \textbf{won first place at the 2022 BYU ACM YHack Hackathon}.
\\
% In the recent past, there has been significant interest in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)—neural networks that operate on graph structured data. Contemporary systems for \textbf{distributed GNN training} have been heavily influenced by, often building upon, existing systems for DNN training and graph processing systems. While in-principle this might look as the most natural path forward, retrofitting algorithms and leveraging tradeoffs designed in context of DNN training and/or graph processing systems lowers compute resource utilization due to communication stalls and more importantly lead to scalability bottlenecks.
% Based on this, I worked with \textbf{Anand Iyer} to build the $\mathbf{P^{3} ~[1]}$ system, which enables efficient distributed training of GNNs on large input graphs. $P^{3}$, published in \textbf{OSDI 2021}, effectively eliminates communication stalls by independently partitioning the graph along feature and structural dimension; unlike just the structural dimension, as done by most partitioners (e.g., METIS) designed for graph processing systems. Such independent partitioning scheme combined with intra-layer model parallelism and pipelining enables new push-pull based distributed training strategy that can outperform previous data parallel methods, achieving low communication and partitioning overhead, and high resource utilization. We are currently integrating pipelined push-pull parallelism in Microsoft's DeepGraph GNN training engine to train state-of-the-art models with thousands of GPUs.

% PROJECT 2: SURGEON - Early-Exit Inference
My passion for leveraging technology to address real-world problems extends beyond NLP. Witnessing my grandmother and other elderly farmers struggle with the physical demands of agriculture due to age and climate challenges, I was inspired to explore robotics and smart farming solutions. I contributed to the development of an autonomous farming robot capable of watering, fertilizing, and weed management through self-learning algorithms and computer vision. This innovation aimed to alleviate the burdens on aging farmers and enhance agricultural productivity in the face of global warming. Our efforts resulted in \textbf{winning the 2023 BYU ITCSA Raspberry Pi Competition}, an award traditionally secured by Electrical and Mechanical Engineering students.
\\
% More recently, I have been looking into \textbf{model serving systems}. Large-scale pre-trained language models such as BERT have brought significant improvements to NLP applications but at the cost of heavy computational burden. A growing body of work aims to alleviate this by exploiting the difference in the classification difficulty among samples and early-exiting at different stages of the network. 
% Although early-exit deep neural networks (EE-DNN) have demonstrated promising accuracy–latency trade-offs, we observe that the coarse-grained batching -- an essential technique to increase throughput, becomes suboptimal in effectively ensuring high hardware utilization as samples dynamically exit at different stages of the network. 
% Thus, with \textbf{Anand Iyer}, I have proposed \textbf{SURGEON [2]}, a system which takes EE-DNN model, throughput and latency requirements as inputs, and produces a model partition and service assignment across heterogeneous resources that satisfies SLA constraints using as few GPUs as possible. 
% Key idea in SURGEON is to consolidate two or more batches at partition boundary, thereby creating a larger batch which  improves hardware efficiency. SURGEON uses dynamic programming to adaptively identify when/how EE-DNN layers are to be partitioned and which/how-many devices are required to service each partition. I am currently evaluating the benefits of SURGEON for different EE-DNN model architectures and service-level objectives.

% Sandia National Laboratories
At \textbf{Sandia National Laboratories}, I tackled cybersecurity challenges by integrating the \textbf{DistilBERT} model with \textbf{Transformer} architectures to classify security log data into 24 categories of cyberattacks. Rapid detection and classification are crucial for organizations to mitigate threats and prevent financial losses. Our model achieved an impressive 99.7\% accuracy and was honored with \textbf{first place in the Machine Learning category at the 2024 BYU Capstone Celebration Competition.}
\\

% Pattern Inc. Experience
During my tenure at \textbf{Pattern Inc.}, a unicorn company specializing in e-commerce solutions, I noticed that support engineers were overwhelmed with repetitive IT tickets. To streamline this process, I pre-trained \textbf{GPT-3.5} and \textbf{LLaMA2} models but found they lacked precision in generating accurate responses. Through research, I implemented a \textbf{Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)} approach combined with \textbf{word embedding} techniques. By vectorizing a bespoke dataset of questions and answers, we automated the IT ticket resolution system, reducing resolution times by 87\% and workload by 78\%. This significant improvement earned me the \textbf{"Employee of the Year"} award among 1780 employees at the Accelerate 24 event, one of the best ECommerce Conferences.
\\

% Other experience
Beyond my research experiences, I bring leadership skills, entrepreneurial drive, and a deep commitment to service that I believe will enrich the Stanford community. As co-founder of \textbf{Glöd AI}, I led a team to develop the world's first AI-driven product advertisement video generation platform. Leading the Tech Team in BYU's \textbf{Korean Business Students Association (KBSA)}, I guided us to \textbf{victory at the 2024 BYU ACM Hackathon} with our AI Shorts Generation Platform. My service as an Operations Specialist in the US Army earned me the \textbf{General Paik Leadership Award}, \textbf{two U.S. Army Commendation Medals}, and the \textbf{2019 Best KATUSA Award}, honing my leadership and collaboration skills. Additionally, I volunteered in Melbourne, Australia, supporting individuals battling addictions for two years.
\\

\textbf{Research Interests}\\
These diverse experiences have equipped me with a unique perspective and a deep understanding of the challenges faced by individuals from various backgrounds. I am eager to leverage these insights to develop innovative solutions at the intersection of \textbf{Natural Language Processing}, \textbf{Computer Vision}, and \textbf{Robotics}, integrating on \textbf{Human-Robot Interaction}. 
\\

One area of concern is addiction recovery; approximately 50\% of Americans aged 12 and older have used illicit drugs at least once, and 14\% struggle with pornography addiction. Overcoming these addictions often requires costly psychological and medical interventions that may not be accessible or appealing to everyone. I envision integrating NLP with robotics to create empathetic companions for individuals battling addiction. By leveraging advanced NLP techniques to recognize and respond to emotional states, these robots could offer nonjudgmental support and companionship akin to a supportive family member or pet, thereby reducing barriers to seeking help and democratizing access to care.
\\

Additionally, I aim to develop machine learning models that predict crop growth based on evolving weather patterns and climate data. By integrating these predictive models with robotics and smart farming technologies, we can optimize agricultural processes like planting, irrigation, and harvesting. Creating autonomous farming robots capable of tasks such as watering, fertilizing, and weed management would enhance crop yields and reduce the physical burden on farmers—particularly benefiting older farmers like my grandmother who struggle with the impacts of climate change. Collaborating with experts in various fields, I hope to develop scalable solutions that address both environmental challenges and global food scarcity.
\\

\textbf{Conclusion} \\
Stanford University's Master of Science in Computer Science program is the ideal environment for me to pursue these ambitions. I am particularly drawn to \textbf{Professor Diyi Yang}'s work as the Director of the \textbf{Social and Language Technologies Lab}. Her research on developing NLP solutions to address societal challenges resonates deeply with my goal of creating empathetic AI counseling tools. Additionally, I am eager to work with \textbf{Professor Jeannette Bohg}, who directs the \textbf{Interactive Perception and Robot Learning Lab}. Her exploration of robust sensorimotor coordination in humans and its implementation on robots, particularly in robotic grasping and manipulation, aligns with my interest in developing therapeutic robotic companions that interact seamlessly with users. Furthermore, \textbf{Professor Dorsa Sadigh}'s research at the intersection of robotics and machine learning, focusing on interactive robot learning and building robots that learn from and adapt to humans, complements my goal of creating adaptive and human-aligned robotic systems. Collaborating within these esteemed labs and \textbf{Stanford Robotics Center} offers the opportunity to meld cutting-edge NLP and robotics research to create impactful solutions that enhance human well-being.
\\

Looking beyond the master's program, I aspire to lead initiatives that bridge government, academia, and industry to combat pervasive issues such as addiction, trauma from abuse, and mental health challenges. By harnessing technology, knowledge, and compassionate leadership, I aim to establish an organization dedicated to providing accessible support systems worldwide. Stanford's resources, network, and culture of innovation will be instrumental in achieving this vision. My unwavering commitment to helping others is the driving force behind my application to Stanford. I believe that with the advanced education and collaborative opportunities the program offers, I can make significant strides in developing technologies that bring healing and support to those in need. No obstacle is insurmountable when one's purpose is rooted in genuine care for others, and I am eager to contribute to the Stanford community while advancing this mission.

% Before MSR, I completed my master's (by research) in Computer and Data Systems at the \textbf{Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore} advised by \textbf{Yogesh Simmhan}. At IISc, my thesis focused on system-side optimizations for \textbf{distributed temporal\footnote{Graphs whose structure and attributes evolve over time} graph analytics}.
% Despite their growing availability, existing abstractions and frameworks do not scale well due to redundant computing and/or messaging across time-points.
% We address this gap through \textbf{\graphite[3]}, which uses time-interval as the data-parallel unit of computation.
% \graphite relies on our novel time-warp operator, which automatically partitions a vertex’s temporal state, and temporally aligns and groups messages to these states. This eases the temporal reasoning required by the user logic, and avoids redundant execution of user logic and messaging within an interval to provide key performance benefits.
% This work was published in \textbf{ICDE 2020} and is currently used at IISc, IIT-Jodhpur, and IIIT-Hyderabad for contact tracing and analytics over temporal graphs\footnote{\url{https://covid19.iisc.ac.in/gocoronago-contact-tracing-app-and-network-analytics/}}.
% \textbf{\wave[4]}, an extension of \graphite, incorporates \textbf{dependency-driven incremental processing} by tracking dependencies to capture how intermediate values get computed, and then uses this information to incrementally propagate the impact of change across intermediate values.
% \wave was presented at the \textbf{2nd ACM Student Research Competition (Graduate Category)} co-located with SOSP 2019. Out of the 15 participating submissions, \wave was one of the 5 finalists and subsequently awarded the Bronze Medal.

%% Non-research accomplishments (e.g. Grades, Academic Service, Work experience) (10-12 lines)

% % Grades
% I realize the need for a strong theoretical foundation to pursue advanced research. In this direction, I have always striven for academic excellence - I stood top of the class during both bachelor's and master's studies.
