# LaTeX Template for Statement of Purpose (SoP)

In the spirit of paying it forward, I'm making my statement of purpose (CS / Systems PhD) and LaTeX template public.

Best of luck, you got this! :)


## How to Compile

After modifying `SoP.tex`, type the following command on the terminal:

```
pdflatex SoP.tex
bibtex SoP
```
